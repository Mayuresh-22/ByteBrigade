Platform Overview

1. Feed & Interaction:
The platformâ€™s central feed enables users (students, alumni, mentors) to post updates, share knowledge, and interact via likes, comments, and shares. Posts can be anything from achievements, upcoming events, job opportunities, or articles related to career growth. Trending topics, highlighted posts, and active discussions encourage community participation, making the feed a lively and engaging space for networking and learning.

2. Event Analytics & Dashboard:
The dashboard offers an interactive view of various events organized by alumni and student groups, such as reunions, webinars, and career fairs. Metrics such as event attendance, feedback, and outcomes (e.g., job placements or mentorships formed) are displayed through graphs and charts. Users can also track historical data for alumni engagement and event success rates, providing an insightful overview of the community's growth and involvement.

3. Messaging System:
The integrated messaging system facilitates private conversations between users. Whether it's alumni offering mentorship, students asking for guidance, or project collaborations, the messaging feature ensures smooth communication. Users can initiate one-on-one or group chats, share files, and view message histories, creating a comprehensive communication tool that supports deeper interaction beyond posts and comments. Additionally, notification alerts keep users updated on new messages and active discussions.
